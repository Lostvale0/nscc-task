## üöÄ Deployment

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment to GitHub Pages.

1. **Trigger**: A deployment is automatically triggered on every `push` to the `main` branch.

2. **Workflow**: The GitHub Actions workflow (`/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) checks out the code, sets up the necessary environment, and deploys the static files.

3. **Result**: The site is automatically built and published to the `gh-pages` branch, making it live at the URL provided above.

This CI/CD pipeline ensures that the live version is always in sync with the latest changes in the `main` branch.
